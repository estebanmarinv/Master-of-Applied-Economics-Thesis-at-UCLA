## Value of Management Skills on Profitability: Evidence from Micro Businesses in Mexico

The following capstone focuses on the value provided by management skills on the profitability of micro businesses in Mexico. Firstly, a literature review on the economics of micro, small and medium business is addressed. Secondly, a statistical description of micro businesses in Mexico is worked out with data from the National Survey of Micro Business 2012, retrieved from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Thirdly, the methodology on how to estimate the impact of the manager’s and the business’ features on profitability of a micro business by doing an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is performed. Fourthly, a discussion on the results from the estimated OLS is set forth, as well as an empirical example on how management skills can predict micro businesses profitability by training three different machine learning classifier algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and a Logistic Regression. Lastly, final comments and future work are discussed.
